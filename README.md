I am a super beginner I justed finished my first Java course so i know this is most likely crigne worthy. I feel as tho it is full of if/else if statements & could used any feeback on this. 
I also cannot figure out why math isnt- well mathing after the second round of attack then health points do not subtract correctly. 
This being said this is not a finished project i just feel like i should make adjustments/changes before the code gets any longer. Any tips or recommendations welcome!
